Okay @Xanoxt there's
other projects that are based on graphene

2
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:21,350
like Decent. Will it work
also for them? Like the exchange?

3
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,840
Okay that's very cool and then so if you
would upvote something which actually

4
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,100
belongs on a Decent Network or on any
other graphene-based [chain] like your music or

5
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:51,169
something then those gateways could be
like configured to send the money on [forwards] or

6
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:53,710
something like that?
