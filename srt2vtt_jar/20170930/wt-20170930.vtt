<font color="Lime">@officialfuzzy: Welcome everybody to another beyond Bitcoin
hangout where you can power</font>

3
00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:14.510 
<font color="Lime">yourself up with your own tokens. Today is
Saturday September 30th 2017 and this</font>

4
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.429 
<font color="Lime">is hangout number 226. We are still in the
beta stages of Whaletank</font>

5
00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:23.150 
<font color="Lime">hangout and Whaleshares so there will be cool
things that do come in the</font>

6
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.569 
<font color="Lime">future. But as of present we have a couple
cool</font>

7
00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:31.960 
<font color="Lime">things already where we like to benefit the
individuals who have a little bit of</font>

8
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.769 
<font color="Lime">interest in creating their own tokens and
potentially leveraging them to help</font>

9
00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:41.179 
<font color="Lime">their own projects. Every week people join up
to the whaletank to talk about</font>

10
00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:45.730 
<font color="Lime">their projects provide updates in what
they're doing in the crypto space. And</font>

11
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.390 
<font color="Lime">hopefully they're also considering how they
can leverage the creation of the</font>

12
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.539 
<font color="Lime">token and the utilization thereof, to not
</font>

13
00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.739 
<font color="Lime">only empower their project but empower the
other people who want to hold those</font>

14
00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.960 
<font color="Lime">tokens and leverage those tokens to help the
project as well. This is one of the</font>

15
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.480 
<font color="Lime">ways that I'm trying to incentivize people to
play around in the sandbox, use</font>

16
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.310 
<font color="Lime">these tokens, see what works, see what
doesn't and help us to document the</font>

17
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:24.020 
<font color="Lime">process and the progress or sometimes the
pitfalls. The entire story thereof.</font>

18
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.910 
<font color="Lime">Now with that said everybody who wants to
post a project can go to the weekly</font>

19
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:36.440 
<font color="Lime">RSVP threads at steemit.com forward slash 
where I</font>

20
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:44.480 
<font color="Lime">post the RSVP hangouts, hangout threads and I
</font>

21
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:50.510 
<font color="Lime">resteem other people's content. And every
week these</font>

22
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:59.180 
<font color="Lime">individuals who join up are allowed to RSVP.
We ask them to get upvotes from</font>

23
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.380 
<font color="Lime">people who are within the community  and
outside of the community to</font>

24
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.989 
<font color="Lime">join up to do so as well. The reason for this
is it shows us that there are</font>

25
00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.210 
<font color="Lime">people within the ecosystem who are willing
to upvote you and kind of step</font>

26
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.600 
<font color="Lime">in and say yes I backed this person. If you
do not</font>

27
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.680 
<font color="Lime">back a person and you do not believe in what
they're doing</font>

28
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:30.140 
<font color="Lime">feel free to post and a reply, as opposed to
a flag, giving information on</font>

29
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.190 
<font color="Lime">what is going on with the individual with the
project at hand. And</font>

30
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.930 
<font color="Lime">if there's something that ends up being
important that we needed to know about I</font>

31
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.330 
<font color="Lime">will always gladly tip people who bring
relevant information in a productive</font>

32
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.360 
<font color="Lime">manner. Now with that said there are a few
cool things that we</font>

33
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.420 
<font color="Lime">offer with power-ups to people who do create
their own tokens and post the</font>

34
00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.600 
<font color="Lime">link to where it trades on the Bitshares DEX.
If you have a token and you are</font>

35
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.400 
<font color="Lime">willing to distribute it to these hangout
attendees and also have it on</font>

36
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.890 
<font color="Lime">the Bitshares DeX, you are able to double the
chances of you becoming of</font>

37
00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:19.250 
<font color="Lime">the first or increase the chances of being in
a preferable order, meaning the</font>

38
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.910 
<font color="Lime">first first second or third in these hangout
segments.</font>

39
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:32.120 
<font color="Lime">If you have a token holding this token and
</font>

40
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.340 
<font color="Lime">posting the link to it will double your
chances as one powerup. As the second</font>

41
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.440 
<font color="Lime">powerup we have 15 minutes that are
established for every project to have as</font>

42
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.660 
<font color="Lime">a base. However you can earn extra minutes by
share dropping on the people</font>

43
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.530 
<font color="Lime">who are going to attend this hangout and are
going to sign the guest list that I</font>

44
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.590 
<font color="Lime">will provide. Now if the community is
interested in that share drop, and once a</font>

45
00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.570 
<font color="Lime">part of that share drop say yes, we can give
you up to ten extra minutes</font>

46
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:07.640 
<font color="Lime">to talk about what is going on. I will always
consider</font>

47
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.829 
<font color="Lime">whether the community is wanting to add extra
minutes because of the</font>

48
00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:19.400 
<font color="Lime">conversation too as well or just for the
tokens. But we will definitely be able to</font>

49
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.200 
<font color="Lime">offer you extra time if you want to leverage
those tokens. And finally we</font>

50
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.669 
<font color="Lime">give out well over five six hundred dollars a
week</font>

51
00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.020 
<font color="Lime">this hangout alone. Historically has actually
been well over</font>

52
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.029 
<font color="Lime">a thousand dollars a week to the people who
participate. And there's nowhere else</font>

53
00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:42.710 
<font color="Lime">that I know of that you can transparently do
this in</font>

54
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.029 
<font color="Lime">the Steem ecosystem and earning these tokens.
So I urge everyone to consider</font>

55
00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:51.439 
<font color="Lime">joining up because those people who do have
their own token and join up and</font>

56
00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:57.800 
<font color="Lime">provide the link for the final powerup that
we offer, you will be able to</font>

57
00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:04.250 
<font color="Lime">potentially earn one thousand beyondbits
which is worth approximately four</font>

58
00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:11.000 
<font color="Lime">hundred dollars at present. So with that said
at the end of every week whenever I</font>

59
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.639 
<font color="Lime">choose that person, if you believe that your
token is more valuable and that</font>

60
00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.680 
<font color="Lime">there might be an opportunity that that you
think that I missed, you can always</font>

61
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.000 
<font color="Lime">reach out to me and talk to me about it after
the fact, and maybe maybe I will</font>

62
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.889 
<font color="Lime">change my mind. But if you do not have a
token that you're leveraging, you will</font>

63
00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:37.789 
<font color="Lime">not be able to earn these thousand
beyondbits. However I do take the amount that</font>

64
00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:42.650 
<font color="Lime">is earned and I distribute it to the people
who join these hangouts as guest</font>

65
00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:48.620 
<font color="Lime">speakers. So with that said if you would like
larger payouts consider trying to</font>

66
00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.569 
<font color="Lime">get the whale tank hangouts uploaded further!
Tell people about them. Tell</font>

67
00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:58.550 
<font color="Lime">people about your project and send a link to
the Whaleshares hangout. Do</font>

68
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.139 
<font color="Lime">what you can to promote us, because promoting
us and what we're doing here</font>

69
00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:08.800 
<font color="Lime">is promoting everybody and also giving us the
resources to continue paying you.</font>

70
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:15.560 
<font color="Lime">Now with that said today the order of
precedence has been established.</font>

71
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.439 
<font color="Lime">from Rudex, at six dollars and seventeen
cents.</font>

72
00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:26.509 
<font color="Lime">Nutela, had some things that he was going to
talk about with Decent,</font>

73
00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:32.240 
<font color="Lime">and he is standing at three dollars and
twenty seven cents.</font>

74
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.279 
<font color="Lime">is going to be talking about addressing
philippine problems monthly.</font>

75
00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:42.980 
<font color="Lime">And that is hashtag for better Philippines on
Steemit. And</font>

76
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:49.580 
<font color="Lime">he is tied with  who will come third.  a
fitness sessions</font>

77
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:55.250 
<font color="Lime">we'll be following that and that will be . We
will then follow</font>

78
00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:02.650 
<font color="Lime">this by GS gaming. And we will cap off the
day with  and his</font>

79
00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:08.780 
<font color="Lime">project buildawale updates. So with that said
I thank everyone who has</font>

80
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.740 
<font color="Lime">joined up today and who join us every week.
And I thank you all for the little</font>

81
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:21.560 
cut

82
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.750 
<font color="Lime">you offer unique value. So always try to
consider how you can leverage that to</font>

83
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:31.250 
<font color="Lime">help each other because that's how we form
synergy and create ridiculous</font>

84
00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:36.530 
<font color="Lime">amounts of value. Now with that said  I'll go
ahead and I'll ask you</font>

85
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:40.490 
<font color="Lime">are you ready to step up to the plate and
give everybody an update on what's</font>

86
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:44.800 
<font color="Lime">going on in the Rudex ecosystem?
</font>

87
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:53.289 position:80%
<font color="Violet">@xanoxt: Sure and I'd like to begin well you said
something about tokens and if you guys</font>

88
00:07:53.289 --> 00:08:06.569 
<font color="Violet">know big Steem started as a translation
project for posts on Steem and for</font>

89
00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:14.430 
<font color="Violet">all the things related to BtiShares, to Steem
[and] to Graphene technology in general.</font>

90
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:26.289 
<font color="Violet">And we were at some point I think it was like
last December or maybe January this</font>

91
00:08:26.289 --> 00:08:36.779 
<font color="Violet">year [that] we're considering creating tokens
to sell translation things and with this</font>

92
00:08:36.779 --> 00:08:45.070 
<font color="Violet">whole thing about community tokens we might
consider doing that actually but</font>

93
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:52.000 
<font color="Violet">it's something that I just wanted to say for
like kind of historical reasons.</font>

94
00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:01.149 
<font color="Violet">We have a team of translators and we have
quite a bit of people who asked us</font>

95
00:09:01.149 --> 00:09:07.779 
<font color="Violet">to translate things. When we started we were
</font>

96
00:09:07.779 --> 00:09:13.360 
<font color="Violet">thinking about how to monetize what we are
doing because you know most of</font>

97
00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:20.470 
<font color="Violet">things we do we do for Steemit votes and
Golos votes. And sometimes they give</font>

98
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:27.130 
<font color="Violet">you nice payout and the translator is happy
because the money goes to the translators.</font>

99
00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:35.290 
<font color="Violet">But sometimes not so much and we were
thinking about things that would allow</font>

100
00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:48.340 
<font color="Violet">to have some sort of stable income. But
instead we went and start doing our</font>

101
00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:52.420 
<font color="Violet">own interface for bitshares and that also
started as the translation</font>

102
00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:58.020 
<font color="Violet">project. Because bitshares didn't have a
Russian interface at the time</font>

103
00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:08.670 
<font color="Violet">and we were approached by testers who said
like "you guys are working on this maybe</font>

104
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:17.130 
<font color="Violet">you want to do Russian tools translation?" We
said yeah sure and then after we did</font>

105
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:21.930 
<font color="Violet">that we thought "okay we have this interface
translation we could probably</font>

106
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:30.560 
<font color="Violet">create our own interface and have a lot of
ideas about what we want to see on</font>

107
00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:40.800 
<font color="Violet">bitshares". And that way we had an ability to
fullfill all of them. For example one of the</font>

108
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:51.050 
<font color="Violet">things that that we have that's different
from when BitShares started is our</font>

109
00:10:51.320 --> 00:11:02.100 
<font color="Violet">telegram based trollbox that we have a
sandboxed iframe with the chat</font>

110
00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:09.120 
<font color="Violet">blog?? A lot of people say that was a
security problem and we spent a lot of</font>

111
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:17.210 
<font color="Violet">time to safeguard this. At some point we were
considering maybe seeing if there's</font>

112
00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:27.450 
<font color="Violet">code for chatbrel?? and working on our own [version] so we would know that it's safe enough.
</font>

113
00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:37.830 
<font color="Violet">Because when you are dealing with
cryptowallets such as Bit-</font>

114
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:48.270 
<font color="Violet">Shares DEX essentially you can't have too
much security. Anyway one of the</font>

115
00:11:48.270 --> 00:12:00.600 
<font color="Violet">things that we always wanted as a Ruble MPA (Market Pegged Asset) and we created it and gave it
</font>

116
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:10.950 
<font color="Violet">to the committee. So it's now an official
Ruble currency MPA of</font>

117
00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:16.990 
<font color="Violet">BitShares and all price
</font>

118
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:26.010 
<font color="Violet">feeds for it are provided by
producing??witnesses. And also after that,</font>

119
00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:33.640 
<font color="Violet">since we position ourselves as Graphene
ambassadors for russian-speaking</font>

120
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:45.280 
<font color="Violet">audience we also worked and talked with
communities of Peerplays, of Muse</font>

121
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:56.130 
<font color="Violet">, of Golos and of Steem and Bitshares itself
and created 0% marketfee</font>

122
00:12:56.130 --> 00:13:04.360 
<font color="Violet">gateways that allow people to trade their
their tokens and exchange their</font>

123
00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:13.360 
<font color="Violet">tokens from Graphene based networks without
any friction other than paying</font>

124
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:21.670 
<font color="Violet">miniscule Bitshares commissions. That is made
possible because we don't have</font>

125
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:31.540 
<font color="Violet">any investors that we have any
responsibilities [to] in turning a</font>

126
00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:43.060 
<font color="Violet">profit and [things] like that. And also
[because] we have an active witness in</font>

127
00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:51.400 
<font color="Violet">all those networks. In Bitshares we're a
producing witness.</font>

128
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:57.760 
<font color="Violet">In Peerplays and in MUSE we're a producing
witness and in Steem and Golos we are</font>

129
00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:08.170 
<font color="Violet">in the top 20 which is maybe one or two
percent ,or I don't know several</font>

130
00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:18.300 
<font color="Violet">hundred thousand or like millions of vests
away from being a top 19 witness</font>

131
00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:24.510 
<font color="Violet">and producing a block every round. But even
even without being there</font>

132
00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:30.960 
<font color="Violet">we're still close to the top. On Steem
currently we've been running witness</font>

133
00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:38.040 
<font color="Violet">since spring. I think it was late March or
early April when we</font>

134
00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:48.600 
<font color="Violet">announced our the launch of our witness. We
are still not in top 50 so if you</font>

135
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:54.720 
<font color="Violet">want to vote for a witness to support
whatever what we are doing, you'll have</font>

136
00:14:54.720 --> 00:15:03.030 
<font color="Violet">to input the witness name in the field for
voting for non-in-the-top witnesses</font>

137
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:14.210 
<font color="Violet">and this name is "Blockchained" like block
chain ed. H opefully we</font>

138
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:22.560 
<font color="Violet">consider that most likely if enough people
vote for us we have to be made</font>

139
00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:31.320 
<font color="Violet">like [rank] 30 and maybe eventually make it
into the top. But top 30 would</font>

140
00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:37.920 
<font color="Violet">be nice and I think it would be enough to
allow us to accelerate what</font>

141
00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:45.260 
<font color="Violet">we're doing by quite a bit. Next up in the
things that we are</font>

142
00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:50.700 
<font color="Violet">planning to do: we are currently tinkering
with with the</font>

143
00:15:50.700 --> 00:16:03.680 
<font color="Violet">Ethereum nodes. We have to run one to be able
to gain?? ERC20 tokens and our</font>

144
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:15.510 
<font color="Violet">first ERC 20 token, once we have that
operational is going to be EOS and I'm</font>

145
00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:25.160 
<font color="Violet">not sure on the particulars yet but most
likely will have a 0% market fee for</font>

146
00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:35.070 
<font color="Violet">EOS token only because at some point it's
going to be a Graphene based token. And once</font>

147
00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:45.649 
<font color="Violet">that's happened we'll create a gateway for
EOS.</font>

148
00:16:45.649 --> 00:16:55.019 
<font color="Violet">Because we think that having Bitshares as a
premier platform for EOS tokens and</font>

149
00:16:55.019 --> 00:17:03.839 
<font color="Violet">all the tokens created on EOS is achievable
and is actually</font>

150
00:17:03.839 --> 00:17:11.730 
<font color="Violet">desirable because as far as I know there are
projects on creating DEXes on EOS</font>

151
00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:25.100 
<font color="Violet">itself but we have the positioning to be
first such a DEX without actually</font>

152
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:32.909 
<font color="Violet">import?? to EOS because graphene chains have
an ability to sidechain to each</font>

153
00:17:32.909 --> 00:17:43.110 
cut

154
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:50.640 
<font color="Violet">would realize the tools to allow that and do
all the research required for</font>

155
00:17:50.640 --> 00:18:03.780 
<font color="Violet">that. Next up we are probably going to try
and backport escrow functionality</font>

156
00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:12.710 
<font color="Violet">from Steem into Bitshares. And we have a team
of people who can work on that.</font>

157
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:23.690 
<font color="Violet">Possibly as soon as we are sure that yeah
that's feasible for us in a short term</font>

158
00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:31.830 
<font color="Violet">will create a working proposal for that if
meirin?? beats?? us to that. Because escrow</font>

159
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:41.429 
<font color="Violet">functionality would allow creation of peer to
peer gating. So you will have</font>

160
00:18:41.429 --> 00:18:46.269 
<font color="Violet">something along the lines of
</font>

161
00:18:46.269 --> 00:18:52.419 
<font color="Violet">local bitcoins. Except local bitcoins are a
centralized service that allows</font>

162
00:18:52.419 --> 00:19:04.619 
<font color="Violet">peer to peer exchanges of bitcoins. [That
said] we were researching using the multi-sig</font>

163
00:19:04.619 --> 00:19:13.259 
<font color="Violet">schemes for that and decided that, while it's
possible it's still a bit clunky.</font>

164
00:19:13.919 --> 00:19:21.159 
<font color="Violet">That's why we kind of shifted it some time
into the</font>

165
00:19:21.159 --> 00:19:29.979 
<font color="Violet">future. Once the tools that offer more
elegant solutions are in</font>

166
00:19:29.979 --> 00:19:42.100 
<font color="Violet">place.That's probably all for now, if you
have any questions... Oh yeah,</font>

167
00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:47.710 
<font color="Violet">another thing is; hopefully if you are going
to Steemfest you will be able to</font>

168
00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:57.700 
<font color="Violet">see me if I get my visa done in a timely
manner. Because if that happens I'll</font>

169
00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:04.419 
<font color="Violet">go to Steemfest and do a presentation there.
But I'll know in maybe a week or</font>

on graphene</font>

172
00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:21.350

the exchange?</font>

<font color="Violet">@xanoxt: Yeah we translated a lot of text for them and
we are planning to have a</font>

174
00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:39.380 
<font color="Violet">Decent gateway also powered by being a
witness on Decent Network. But it's</font>

175
00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:49.280 
<font color="Violet">probably going to be after an ERC20 gateway.
Since it's not that</font>

176
00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:53.450 
<font color="Violet">hard to create gateways for graphene-based
</font>

177
00:20:53.450 --> 00:21:00.050 
<font color="Violet">systems for us, it might happen before the
ERC20 gateway but I'm not sure</font>

178
00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:09.590 
<font color="Violet">on the timeline. But yeah that's in our plans
and if you launch in</font>

179
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:20.300 
<font color="Violet">a Graphene based Network and you have a solid
community and solid business case</font>

180
00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:31.370 
<font color="Violet">for use of blockchain and are looking to
listed it we are open to providing</font>

181
00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:40.900 
<font color="Violet">gateways to the DEX because as far as we are
concerned DEX is the thing that</font>

182
00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:49.460 
<font color="Violet">tie all the Graphene based chains together.
And any other</font>

183
00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:59.120 
<font color="Violet">chains as well. But we first look for several
things: one of them is; if the</font>

184
00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:07.550 
<font color="Violet">blockchain in question has any sort of
governance solutions, so you can in the</font>

185
00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:15.650 
<font color="Violet">future expect to see maybe Decred or I don't
know - DASH. The second</font>

186
00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:22.610 
<font color="Violet">thing is privacy centric block chains that's
something that we really like. So</font>

187
00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:30.860 
<font color="Violet">Monero, ZCash, I don't know PIVX or well
whatever, are</font>

188
00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:34.989 
<font color="Violet">the chains that have functionality we are
looking into</font>

189
00:22:34.989 --> 00:22:48.220 
<font color="Violet">creating but that's probably going to be in
2018, maybe earlier. Our</font>

190
00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:57.999 
<font color="Violet">idea is that we want to move at the pace
that's comfortable for us. So we are</font>

cut

192
00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:11.210 
<font color="Violet">chains it's maybe like we got to asses about
that, we got to to set up the</font>

193
00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:17.470 
<font color="Violet">infrastructure for that and now that we have,
to test that and release into the</font>

194
00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:24.289 
<font color="Violet">to the public. And then another couple of
weeks to do a public testing before we</font>

195
00:23:24.289 --> 00:23:31.009 
<font color="Violet">send the code upstream. So it can be included
into the reference wallets and</font>

196
00:23:31.009 --> 00:23:38.769 
<font color="Violet">into any other the Bitshares based
interfaces.</font>

197
00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.840 position:20%
<font color="Cyan">@nutela: Okay that's very cool and then so if you
would upvote something which actually</font>

198
00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:46.100 
<font color="Cyan">belongs on a Decent Network or on any other
graphene-based [chain] like your music or</font>

199
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:51.169 
<font color="Cyan">something then those gateways could be like
configured to send the money on [forwards] or</font>

200
00:23:51.169 --> 00:23:53.710 
<font color="Cyan">something like that?
</font>

201

<font color="Violet">@xanoxt: You'll still have to do it via Bitshares. You
send your money to for example</font>

202
00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:06.920 
<font color="Violet">Decent gateway on Bitshares. You get Rudex
decent tokens or</font>

203
00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:12.800 
<font color="Violet">whatever they're going to be called. Then you
go and exchange them for, I don't</font>

204
00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:21.170 
<font color="Violet">know Rudex tokens, and can then send them to
news network. And the thing</font>

205
00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:30.350 
<font color="Violet">is since there are a 0% market fees we're not
actually taking any money from</font>

206
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:40.040 
<font color="Violet">from those trades. And since most most
graphene-based block chains don't</font>

207
00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:49.580 
<font color="Violet">have sending or receiving fees or transaction
fees. We we have zero</font>

208
00:24:49.580 --> 00:25:00.320 
<font color="Violet">transaction fees to send it this way or that.
And even with Bitshares and Peer-</font>

209
00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:05.210 
<font color="Violet">plays that have those transaction fees, since
we are getting paid by the</font>

210
00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:15.680 
<font color="Violet">blockchain and the volume on on those
movements is offset by those payments so</font>

211
00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:30.830 
<font color="Violet">we are able to afford that, there are minimum
amounts that we process. But</font>

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:46.340 
<font color="Violet">you're sending money from one blockchain to
another. But it still requires</font>

depending on how liquid the</font>
