00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,439
Welcome everybody to another beyond
Bitcoin hangout where you can power

2
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:14,510
yourself up with your own tokens. Today
is Saturday September 30th 2017 and this

3
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:19,429
is hangout number 226. We are
still in the beta stages of Whaletank

4
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:23,150
hangout and Whaleshares so there will
be cool things that do come in the

5
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,569
future.
But as of present we have a couple cool

6
00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:31,960
things already where we like to benefit
the individuals who have a little bit of

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,769
interest in creating their own tokens
and potentially leveraging them to help

8
00:00:36,769 --> 00:00:41,179
their own projects. Every week people
join up to the whaletank to talk about

9
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:45,730
their projects provide updates in what
they're doing in the crypto space. And

10
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:50,390
hopefully they're also considering how
they can leverage the creation of the

11
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:56,539
token and the utilization thereof, to not

12
00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:00,739
only empower their project but empower
the other people who want to hold those

13
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:05,960
tokens and leverage those tokens to help
the project as well. This is one of the

14
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,480
ways that I'm trying to incentivize
people to play around in the sandbox, use

15
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,310
these tokens, see what works, see what
doesn't and help us to document the

16
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:24,020
process and the progress or sometimes
the pitfalls. The entire story thereof.

17
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:28,910
Now with that said everybody who wants
to post a project can go to the weekly

18
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:36,440
RSVP threads at steemit.com forward
slash @officialfuzzy where I

19
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:44,480
post the RSVP hangouts, hangout threads and I

20
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:50,510
resteem other people's content.
And every week these

21
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:59,180
individuals who join up are allowed to
RSVP. We ask them to get upvotes from

22
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,380
people who are within the community  and outside of the community to

23
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:08,989
join up to do so as well. The reason
for this is it shows us that there are

24
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:14,210
people within the ecosystem who are
willing to upvote you and kind of step

25
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:17,600
in and say yes I backed this person. If you do not

26
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,680
back a person and you do not believe in
what they're doing

27
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:30,140
feel free to post and a reply, as opposed
to a flag, giving information on

28
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:34,190
what is going on with the
individual with the project at hand. And

29
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:38,930
if there's something that ends up being
important that we needed to know about I

30
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:44,330
will always gladly tip people who bring
relevant information in a productive

31
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:50,360
manner. Now with that said there are a
few cool things that we

32
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:56,420
offer with power-ups to people who do
create their own tokens and post the

33
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:02,600
link to where it trades on the Bitshares
DEX. If you have a token and you are

34
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,400
willing to distribute it to these
hangout attendees and also have it on

35
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,890
the Bitshares DeX, you are able to
double the chances of you becoming of

36
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:19,250
the first or increase the chances of
being in a preferable order, meaning the

37
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:25,910
first first second or third in these
hangout segments.

38
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:32,120
If you have a token holding this token and

39
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,340
posting the link to it will double your
chances as one powerup. As the second

40
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:42,440
powerup we have 15 minutes that are
established for every project to have as

41
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:47,660
a base. However you can earn extra
minutes by share dropping on the people

42
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,530
who are going to attend this hangout and
are going to sign the guest list that I

43
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:57,590
will provide. Now if the community is
interested in that share drop, and once a

44
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:02,570
part of that share drop say yes,
we can give you up to ten extra minutes

45
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:07,640
to talk about what is going on. I will
always consider

46
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,829
whether the community is wanting
to add extra minutes because of the

47
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:19,400
conversation too as well or just for the
tokens. But we will definitely be able to

48
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,200
offer you extra time if you want to
leverage those tokens. And finally we

49
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,669
give out well over five six hundred
dollars a week

50
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:33,020
this hangout alone.
Historically has actually been well over

51
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:38,029
a thousand dollars a week to the people
who participate. And there's nowhere else

52
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:42,710
that I know of that you can transparently do this in

53
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:47,029
the Steem ecosystem and earning these
tokens. So I urge everyone to consider

54
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:51,439
joining up because those people who do
have their own token and join up and

55
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:57,800
provide the link for the final powerup
that we offer, you will be able to

56
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:04,250
potentially earn one thousand beyondbits which is worth approximately four

57
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:11,000
hundred dollars at present. So with that
said at the end of every week whenever I

58
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,639
choose that person, if you believe that
your token is more valuable and that

59
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,680
there might be an opportunity that that
you think that I missed, you can always

60
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,000
reach out to me and talk to me about it
after the fact, and maybe maybe I will

61
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,889
change my mind. But if you do not have a
token that you're leveraging, you will

62
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:37,789
not be able to earn these thousand beyondbits. However I do take the amount that

63
00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:42,650
is earned and I distribute it to the
people who join these hangouts as guest

64
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:48,620
speakers. So with that said if you would
like larger payouts consider trying to

65
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:53,569
get the whale tank hangouts uploaded
further! Tell people about them. Tell

66
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:58,550
people about your project and send a
link to the Whaleshares hangout. Do

67
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:03,139
what you can to promote us, because
promoting us and what we're doing here

68
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:08,800
is promoting everybody and also giving
us the resources to continue paying you.

69
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:15,560
Now with that said today the order of
precedence has been established. @Xanoxt

70
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,439
from Rudex, at six dollars and
seventeen cents.

71
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:26,509
Nutela, had some things that he was
going to talk about with Decent,

72
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:32,240
and he is standing at three
dollars and twenty seven cents. @asbonclz

73
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,279
is going to be talking about
addressing philippine problems monthly.

74
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:42,980
And that is hashtag
for better Philippines on Steemit. And

75
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:49,580
he is tied with @Nutela who will come
third. @Voiceshares a fitness sessions

76
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:55,250
we'll be following that and that will be
@rideofpassion. We will then follow

77
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:02,650
this by GS gaming. And we will cap off
the day with @theMarkyMark and his

78
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:08,780
project buildawale updates. So with
that said I thank everyone who has

79
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,740
joined up today and who join us every
week. And I thank you all for the little

80
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:21,560
things that you do that help us. All of
you offer incredible value. And all of

81
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,750
you offer unique value. So always try to
consider how you can leverage that to

82
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:31,250
help each other because that's how we
form synergy and create ridiculous

83
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:36,530
amounts of value. Now with that said
@Xanoxt I'll go ahead and I'll ask you

84
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:40,490
are you ready to step up to the plate
and give everybody an update on what's

85
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:44,800
going on in the Rudex ecosystem?

86
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:24,479
Okay @Xanoxt really quickly I can
give you about 20 more seconds if that's

87
00:26:24,479 --> 00:26:28,739
okay? We're a little bit over the 15
minutes but you're more than welcome to

88
00:26:28,739 --> 00:26:32,809
join up every week and give us a status
as well.

89
00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:06,260
Thank @Xanoxt and if people want
to reach out to you guys and ask you any

90
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:12,380
questions, or heck maybe they know of a
chain or a graphene-based chain or

91
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:17,900
something similar like bitshares 1.0
based kind of chain, a graphene 1.0 chain.

92
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:22,340
How would they reach out to you and
contact you to let you know about all

93
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,580
this stuff?

94
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:02,790
Sounds good and thank you very much
everybody for joining up to these

95
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:07,380
hangouts and participating in them.
Thank you @Xanoxt for joining up to

96
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:11,730
provide all this information. You see
these are things that a lot of people do

97
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:16,770
not know about and they should. And this
is one of the means of us getting this

98
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:21,179
information out in a way that is open
and transparent. I just want to urge

99
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:26,070
everyone here, who is part of these and
those of you who are listening, to

100
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:29,700
consider,
we have 2500 listeners just on

101
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:34,380
soundcloud a week. So we have people out
there who are paying attention and

102
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:39,090
listening to us as well. If you're a
listener and or you're in

103
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:43,110
here, please conside if there's a
project that really seems like it's

104
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:47,580
going to bring value to your stake and
that you think that you can add value to

105
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,150
them and give them a little bit of help
in any way shape or form it, does not

106
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:56,340
have to be always money. This is the
space of disruption, the disruption comes

107
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:02,429
from creation and innovation. So innovate
and use your own value propositions to

108
00:29:02,429 --> 00:29:06,480
uplift and support these valuable
projects. Because without these projects

109
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,610
we're kind of standing still in the
water. And it's really important. It's

110
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:15,690
really important to help them. And I know
that I don't always do it perfectly but

111
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:20,070
I will say this just always try if you
can. If there's a project that seems

112
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:23,700
valuable to you even if it's just one or
two minutes to share something every

113
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,980
week, it's something they might not
otherwise have.
