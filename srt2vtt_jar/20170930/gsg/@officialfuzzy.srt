1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,350
I've noticed that you are also
a busy guy on there so go ahead and feel

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,240
free to step up let everybody know give
your 15 minute presentation and we can

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,630
move forward

4
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,220
and that is @Zord189

5
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,550
as in Delta

6
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:08,580
sure have you ever thought about the
potential of tokenification for gaming

7
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,780
for this kind of group like
creating a community token well it's

8
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,590
it's I think a steem media token is what
they're going to call them when they

9
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:22,919
come out but we have tokens that can be
used for that up until then

10
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:43,240
well that's one of the things
I'll help you with if you need just so

11
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,390
you know

12
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:33,680
this is some cool stuff
but I think that the the gaming segment

13
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,389
that sector in general there's just so
much you can do in it so it's gonna be

14
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:42,139
cool to see where you're going with it
and I'll also remind you that there is

15
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:46,820
another chain another delegated people
stakechain called peer plays

16
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:55,100
some of the people who were
behind bitshares work with it and they

17
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:01,400
are going to be having it used just for
games and gamification and things like

18
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,190
that and I believe
they're going to have a unit a unity API

19
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:11,060
so I just want to let you guys know it's cheaper than when

20
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,530
I bought it so you guys can get it
cheaper than I bought it and I know that

21
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:18,620
they're doing stuff behind the scenes
from what they've told

22
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:25,550
me anyway and they've came out and
they've been pretty open about

23
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:30,950
joining the whale tanks in the past to
talk about it too so the only reason I

24
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:35,180
bring that up is you're in this perfect
spot where you're on steemit you could

25
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,620
make money and earn money and build a
community there and you can also create

26
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:45,010
kind of a synergy between steemit and
peer plays with that right

27
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,389
so yeah I mean if we can use these tools
to make more money on more platforms

28
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:52,810
like kind of how I tell @nutela
hey feel free to put all of our stuff

29
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:56,260
from the cent and if you want to kick me
some of the funds that you were in cool

30
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:01,000
if you don't that's fine too but you
leverage it and and earn on decent you

31
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,760
know what I mean that's another platform
that you guys like and it's based on

32
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,600
delegated proof of stakes so you know
it's gonna scale you know it's not gonna

33
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,660
have a bunch of people who want to use
it and then they're gonna go shit I

34
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,810
can't use it
so maybe just something to think about

35
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,350
for you

36
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,820
if you want to you could probably create
the discord yourself because I don't

37
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,450
think they have a discord they have a

38
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:37,230
telegram though

39
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,590
there you go apple crisp

40
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:56,650
well they are looking for people to get
witnesses and I mean it's

41
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:02,310
just it's just too good to be true that
you can earn from all these chains and

42
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:07,870
yeah it's called Voltron BamBam
 and if you do it I

43
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:13,020
think that you'll be very happy
that you helped to build Voltron

44
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:22,150
or Ultron is my manager Mike wants to
keep saying so if anybody wants to reach

45
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:25,479
out to you how do they do so if they
want to help out or work with you in

46
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:28,919
some way shape or form with this project

47
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,840
could you provide the link in here for
the for the people who are joining up

48
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,689
today
that'd be awesome just so they have

49
00:09:00,689 --> 00:09:06,360
access to to see what you're up to and
you never know when you

50
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,110
start looking at these various other
chains in it you can potentially make

51
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:15,179
some cash on all those you start being
able to potentially help people who join

52
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:19,499
up and become part of the community
maybe some of the people here will be

53
00:09:19,499 --> 00:09:22,399
some of those people

54
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:39,290
does anybody have any questions or
comments before we close this segment up

55
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:42,430
we have five minutes left

56
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:47,280
my big thing is if you have a
coin that it cannot really

57
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:53,160
give people an opportunity to govern
their community or have some

58
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,150
semblance of structure that they can
 leverage to get things

59
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:02,790
done that's one of the biggest things
 that coins are gonna have

60
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:06,390
to deal with that and scalability if
you've got those two things as a coin

61
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:13,500
your community is going to be able to
survive through the hard times and you

62
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:18,710
will find those core people but I think
over time you guys might see that if

63
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:23,010
for instance some of these other texts
out there if they don't scale and

64
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:29,940
the only thing that they offer is "you
don't like it sell your coin" I think that's

65
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:36,120
going to be the mark of what's
going to make a shit coin a true shit

66
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,020
coin because if we're thinking about
cryptocurrency is something that's going

67
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:45,210
to empower people and it doesn't empower
people other than to buy the coin and

68
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:49,470
hold it and spend it and be a nice
little servant who doesn't ask questions

69
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:56,400
what happens with it or to be
able to be a citizen who has a say kind

70
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,690
of like and delegated proof of stake I
think there's a big big difference and

71
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:06,470
especially for longevity of coins and
the communities

72
00:15:07,499 --> 00:15:12,339
especially for the toilet flushing
people the people who live their lives

73
00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:15,179
around the toilets

74
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:29,040
okay well real quick before  we
head out I just want to thank you

75
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:37,970

00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:42,990
thank you for joining up please feel
free to join up any  time and remind

77
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:48,810
me that man I'll do it
today with you I can make a token in

78
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:57,649
probably about twenty minutes during the after party if that's cool

79
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:07,149
sounds good

80
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:15,870
hmm well give him a reason to hold man
tell them all your ideas that's that's

81
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,730
the best thing to combat the FUD

82
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:32,430
well you'll figure it out and we'll talk
about probably the next time you

83
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:35,360
join up sound good

84
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:40,210
