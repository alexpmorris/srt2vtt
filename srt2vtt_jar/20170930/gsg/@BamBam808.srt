1
00:00:00,449 --> 00:00:04,110
always my friends

2
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:18,250
yeah if anybody has anything we need to
add this probably won't take 15 minutes

3
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:23,259
as I was just on you know a couple weeks
kind of discussing it but I just wanted

4
00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:27,880
to kind of do an update regarding where
we're at and some of the things that

5
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:34,440
have changed thus far first off we've
been able to get with a really cool guy

6
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:42,129
@absord189 and he's able to 
create banners intro videos anything

7
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:47,199
like that so if you guys are ever
needing anything like that go for the

8
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:53,350
@absord189 I would give my full backing
if you ever need anything like that so

9
00:00:53,350 --> 00:01:00,039
yeah we've got a our official logo
we've actually had a few gaming

10
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:05,710
spotlights where we spotlight the
authors yeah check all post here

11
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:08,280
in a second

12
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:16,820
and then basically what we've decided to
do is in order to kind of push our

13
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:22,490
community forward is use the GS gaming
account, the steemit account as

14
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:28,909
spotlight account which basically allows
for any of the gaming members to post

15
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:33,979
from their personal accounts using the
GSG pictures and logos and

16
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:41,149
whatnot and thenh
either @BTCvenom or I will go through on

17
00:01:41,149 --> 00:01:46,640
the GS gaming account and spotlight this
author and what it ends up doing is

18
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,960
goes through the week payout
and they receive all the SBD so we're

19
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:57,560
using it as a way to kind of help
authors and feel a little more loved

20
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,270
because we all know there's
quite the learning curve on Steemit so

21
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:07,700
I think we're at about 35
members now I think last week we were at

22
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,709
about eleven so it's a gonna take a
little time to get huge but I think it's

23
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:17,390
it's moving in the right direction so
we're always looking for more people to

24
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:24,230
come over and jump over I'll put the
discord link and

25
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:29,209
any links that I might have that might
be of importance I'll link sword 189

26
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:35,200
because he does some awesome work as
well thank you

27
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,569
yes sir

28
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,950
yep Delta
but yeah he does really good work

29
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:53,600
he's brand new to steemit so

30
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:59,360
wanted to make sure he gets a little
you know love from whoever the community

31
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,400
that chooses to use his services because
he does a really good job and

32
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,880
most of the stuff he's been just
wanting to do it out of the love of his

33
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,890
heart I have always been trying to send
him compensation and whatnot

34
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:19,370
but yeah he's a really good guy
anyways GetSetGaming is taking off

35
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:25,820
so I would be looking for it on the
steemit hot or trending here in the

36
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:30,680
next little while as far as for gaming
we brought on a few other people and

37
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:37,370
have been discussing with some possible
backers but we shall see I think it'll

38
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:42,230
just be one of those we grow as a
community and you know

39
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:46,750
"big payouts" come later for everybody
I'm doing what I can using personal

40
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:53,560
whale shares and whatnot to support the
authors through the GS gaming account so

41
00:03:53,560 --> 00:04:04,209
anyways that is my kind of top up and
GetSetGaming news thank you guys

42
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:25,120
yeah the old snts yeah I
think ideally I would love to do

43
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,320
something like that I personally don't
know how to do that but if you have

44
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,860
somebody that you could link me with I
would be extremely interested for that

45
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:39,120
as well as I think steemits got talent
that it could use from that as well also

46
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:48,739
awesome I'll reach out to p.m. here
sometime today then I know you're busy

47
00:04:48,739 --> 00:04:51,709
busy busy
the other thing I wanted to just briefly

48
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:57,499
announce was yes @steempowerpics
 read my mind we've actually

49
00:04:57,499 --> 00:05:05,359
been in discussion with Chris  of solar coach TopSol and he's

50
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:10,219
actually decided to give up five hundred
topsol a week to the winner of Steemits

51
00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:14,209
got talent so that'll be another
especially going into the

52
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:19,609
eliminations here in the next few weeks
I think it'll be a nice way to bump up

53
00:05:19,609 --> 00:05:27,849
prizes and whatnot for the elimination
people

54
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,850
yeah that would be awesome

55
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:21,170
definitely do you happen I don't even
think I have the a discord for peer

56
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:25,640
plays you have anybody I might be able
to contact or I'll just reach out in

57
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,970
p.m.

58
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:41,010
okay awesome I do have telegram so I'll
look around there but yeah I'll try and

59
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:46,080
get in touch with one of them and you
know if I could make a discord for him

60
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,980
that would be awesome too

61
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:05,570
yeah that's what I thought

62
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:15,610
awesome awesome

63
00:08:27,619 --> 00:08:35,029
as far as the GS gaming I will put down
my discord port the community discord

64
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:41,779
but I'm basically as fuzzy will probably
vouch I'm always on discord I kind of

65
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:45,920
jump on steemit.chat here and there you
know a couple times a day just to check

66
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,529
but discord is my main bread and butter
I'm there pretty much 24/7 so that would

67
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:56,350
be the easiest way to meet me find me

68
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,280
yes sir

69
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:29,430
sounds good I'm all about helping
anybody I can

70
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:48,779
a top-class so anybody who wants to take
over this five minutes feel free

71
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,180
yeah I was kind of doing the similar
thing that you're doing I was kind of

72
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,120
reaching out to the community that just
kind of compiled

73
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,690
you know a general consensus of at least
the people that I reach out and follow

74
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:17,550
or who follow me I wanted to get kind of
their general consensus as far as what I

75
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:23,660
think I mean I think it's a cool way to
get around you know the whole ICO

76
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:30,390
situation that's going on right now but
on the flip side I think it's something

77
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:35,910
that's more or less already been done
you know whaleshares that kind of a

78
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:41,190
thing similar but different so I think
it'll be interesting I think it's going

79
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:45,720
to initially be a whole flood of
"BS" that everyone's going

80
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,460
to kind of have to go through because I didn't read the

81
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:55,820
entire white paper but I don't know 
what system they're using to

82
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:02,940
you know "vent through the
BS" and the scam tokens and whatnot

83
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,240
I don't know if it's just going to be
whoever makes one can enter it and use

84
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:13,310
steemit as the ICO platform but I think
 only time will tell

85
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:47,810
as we've seen the steemit

86
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:51,920
community issues pop up and there's
people that necessarily don't

87
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,580
Use Steemit the platform for what it's
for but I think the community does a

88
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:00,740
really good job of you know weeding
out the BS and then really getting down

89
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:05,810
to the the good core community you know
people who really care about steemit so

90
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:09,830
I think it's going to be a similar event
with these ICOS I think

91
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:13,130
initially it's just gonna flood the
market and then everyone's gonna have to

92
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:19,240
kind of okay this is the one to go to
this is not you know like that

93
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:25,180
no nobody wants to listen to you

94
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,720
damn toilet flexors

95
00:15:54,990 --> 00:16:00,089
Roger that sounds great to me man
I appreciate it I'm already in the

96
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:05,070
telegram talking to go to play guys or
trying to they're in there in

97
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:12,050
some serious discussions going on right
now buy sell hold

98
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:23,130
yeah they're talking about something
else helmbet something

99
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,860
not quite sure what it even is

100
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,480
sounds good
