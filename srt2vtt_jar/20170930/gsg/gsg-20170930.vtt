00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.259 
<font color="Lime">as I was just on you know a couple weeks kind
of discussing it but I just wanted</font>

8
00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.880 
<font color="Lime">to kind of do an update regarding where we're
at and some of the things that</font>

9
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.440 
<font color="Lime">have changed thus far first off we've been
able to get with a really cool guy</font>

10
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:42.129 
<font color="Lime"> and he's able to create banners intro videos
anything</font>

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.199 
<font color="Lime">like that so if you guys are ever needing
anything like that go for the</font>

12
00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:53.350 
<font color="Lime"> I would give my full backing if you ever need
anything like that so</font>

13
00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:00.039 
<font color="Lime">yeah we've got a our official logo we've
actually had a few gaming</font>

14
00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:05.710 
<font color="Lime">spotlights where we spotlight the authors
yeah check all post here</font>

15
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.280 
<font color="Lime">in a second
</font>

16
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:16.820 
<font color="Lime">and then basically what we've decided to do
is in order to kind of push our</font>

17
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.490 
<font color="Lime">community forward is use the GS gaming
account, the steemit account as</font>

18
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.909 
<font color="Lime">spotlight account which basically allows for
any of the gaming members to post</font>

19
00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.979 
<font color="Lime">from their personal accounts using the GSG
pictures and logos and</font>

20
00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:41.149 
<font color="Lime">whatnot and thenh either  or I will go
through on</font>

21
00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.640 
<font color="Lime">the GS gaming account and spotlight this
author and what it ends up doing is</font>

22
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.960 
<font color="Lime">goes through the week payout and they receive
all the SBD so we're</font>

23
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.560 
<font color="Lime">using it as a way to kind of help authors and
feel a little more loved</font>

24
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.270 
<font color="Lime">because we all know there's quite the
learning curve on Steemit so</font>

25
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.700 
<font color="Lime">I think we're at about 35 members now I think
last week we were at</font>

26
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.709 
<font color="Lime">about eleven so it's a gonna take a little
time to get huge but I think it's</font>

27
00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.390 
<font color="Lime">it's moving in the right direction so we're
always looking for more people to</font>

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.600 
<font color="Lime">he's brand new to steemit so
</font>

36
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.360 
<font color="Lime">wanted to make sure he gets a little you know
love from whoever the community</font>

37
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.400 
<font color="Lime">that chooses to use his services because he
does a really good job and</font>

38
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.880 
<font color="Lime">most of the stuff he's been just wanting to
do it out of the love of his</font>

39
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
<font color="Lime">heart I have always been trying to send him
compensation and whatnot</font>

40
00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:19.370 
<font color="Lime">but yeah he's a really good guy anyways
GetSetGaming is taking off</font>

41
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:25.820 
<font color="Lime">so I would be looking for it on the steemit
hot or trending here in the</font>

42
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.680 
<font color="Lime">next little while as far as for gaming we
brought on a few other people and</font>

43
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:37.370 
<font color="Lime">have been discussing with some possible
backers but we shall see I think it'll</font>

44
00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.230 
<font color="Lime">just be one of those we grow as a community
and you know</font>

45
00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.750 
<font color="Lime">"big payouts" come later for everybody I'm
doing what I can using personal</font>

46
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:53.560 
<font color="Lime">whale shares and whatnot to support the
authors through the GS gaming account so</font>

47
00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:04.209 
<font color="Lime">anyways that is my kind of top up and
GetSetGaming news thank you guys</font>

48
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.580 position:20%
<font color="Cyan">@officialfuzzy: sure have you ever thought about the
potential of tokenification for gaming</font>

49
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.780 
<font color="Cyan">for this kind of group like creating a
community token well it's</font>

50
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.590 
<font color="Cyan">it's I think a steem media token is what
they're going to call them when they</font>

51
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.919 
<font color="Cyan">come out but we have tokens that can be used
for that up until then</font>

52
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:25.120 position:80%
<font color="Lime">@BamBam808: yeah the old snts yeah I think ideally I
would love to do</font>

53
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.320 
<font color="Lime">something like that I personally don't know
how to do that but if you have</font>

54
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.860 
<font color="Lime">somebody that you could link me with I would
be extremely interested for that</font>

55
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:39.120 
<font color="Lime">as well as I think steemits got talent that
it could use from that as well also</font>

56
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.240 position:20%
<font color="Cyan">@officialfuzzy: well that's one of the things I'll help you
with if you need just so</font>

</font>

59
00:04:48.739 --> 00:04:51.709 
<font color="Lime">@BamBam808: busy busy the other thing I wanted to just
briefly</font>

60
00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:57.499 
<font color="Lime">announce was yes  read my mind we've actually
</font>

61
00:04:57.499 --> 00:05:05.359 
<font color="Lime">been in discussion with Chris  of solar coach
TopSol and he's</font>

62
00:05:05.359 --> 00:05:10.219 
<font color="Lime">actually decided to give up five hundred
topsol a week to the winner of Steemits</font>

63
00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:14.209 
<font color="Lime">got talent so that'll be another especially
going into the</font>

64
00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:19.609 
<font color="Lime">eliminations here in the next few weeks I
think it'll be a nice way to bump up</font>

65
00:05:19.609 --> 00:05:27.849 
<font color="Lime">prizes and whatnot for the elimination people
</font>

66
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:33.680 position:20%
<font color="Cyan">@officialfuzzy: this is some cool stuff but I think that the
the gaming segment</font>

67
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.389 
<font color="Cyan">that sector in general there's just so much
you can do in it so it's gonna be</font>

68
00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:42.139 
<font color="Cyan">cool to see where you're going with it and
I'll also remind you that there is</font>

69
00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.820 
<font color="Cyan">another chain another delegated people
stakechain called peer plays</font>

70
00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:55.100 
<font color="Cyan">some of the people who were behind bitshares
work with it and they</font>

71
00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:01.400 
<font color="Cyan">are going to be having it used just for games
and gamification and things like</font>

72
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.190 
<font color="Cyan">that and I believe they're going to have a
unit a unity API</font>

73
00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:11.060 
<font color="Cyan">so I just want to let you guys know it's
cheaper than when</font>

74
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.530 
<font color="Cyan">I bought it so you guys can get it cheaper
than I bought it and I know that</font>

75
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.620 
<font color="Cyan">they're doing stuff behind the scenes from
what they've told</font>

76
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:25.550 
<font color="Cyan">me anyway and they've came out and they've
been pretty open about</font>

77
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.950 
<font color="Cyan">joining the whale tanks in the past to talk
about it too so the only reason I</font>

78
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:35.180 
<font color="Cyan">bring that up is you're in this perfect spot
where you're on steemit you could</font>

79
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:39.620 
<font color="Cyan">make money and earn money and build a
community there and you can also create</font>

80
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:45.010 
<font color="Cyan">kind of a synergy between steemit and peer
plays with that right</font>

81
00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.850 position:80%
<font color="Lime">@BamBam808: yeah that would be awesome
</font>

82
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.389 position:20%
<font color="Cyan">@officialfuzzy: so yeah I mean if we can use these tools to
make more money on more platforms</font>

83
00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:52.810 
<font color="Cyan">like kind of how I tell  hey feel free to put
all of our stuff</font>

84
00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.260 
<font color="Cyan">from the cent and if you want to kick me some
of the funds that you were in cool</font>

85
00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:01.000 
<font color="Cyan">if you don't that's fine too but you leverage
it and and earn on decent you</font>

86
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.760 
<font color="Cyan">know what I mean that's another platform that
you guys like and it's based on</font>

87
00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.600 
<font color="Cyan">delegated proof of stakes so you know it's
gonna scale you know it's not gonna</font>

88
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.660 
<font color="Cyan">have a bunch of people who want to use it and
then they're gonna go shit I</font>

89
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.810 
<font color="Cyan">can't use it so maybe just something to think
about</font>

90
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.350 
<font color="Cyan">for you
</font>

91
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:21.170 position:80%
<font color="Lime">@BamBam808: definitely do you happen I don't even think I

<font color="Cyan">@officialfuzzy: if you want to you could probably create the
discord yourself because I don't</font>

95
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:34.450 
<font color="Cyan">think they have a discord they have a

96
00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:37.230 
<font color="Cyan">telegram though
</font>

97

around there but yeah I'll try and</font>

<font color="Lime">get in touch with one of them and you know if
I could make a discord for him</font>

witnesses and I mean it's</font>

102
00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:02.310 
<font color="Cyan">just it's just too good to be true that you
can earn from all these chains and</font>

103
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:05.570 position:80%
<font color="Lime">@BamBam808: yeah that's what I thought

it I</font>

105
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:13.020

<font color="Lime">but I'm basically as fuzzy will probably
vouch I'm always on discord I kind of</font>

112
00:08:41.779 --> 00:08:45.920 
<font color="Lime">jump on steemit.chat here and there you know
a couple times a day just to check</font>

<font color="Violet">because you wrote a post about it I just read
it so maybe we can talk about that</font>

129
00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:03.180 position:80%
<font color="Lime">@BamBam808: yeah I was kind of doing the similar thing
that you're doing I was kind of</font>

130
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.120 
<font color="Lime">reaching out to the community that just kind
of compiled</font>

131
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.690 
<font color="Lime">you know a general consensus of at least the
people that I reach out and follow</font>

132
00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:17.550 
<font color="Lime">or who follow me I wanted to get kind of
their general consensus as far as what I</font>

133
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:23.660 
<font color="Lime">think I mean I think it's a cool way to get
around you know the whole ICO</font>

134
00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:30.390 
<font color="Lime">situation that's going on right now but on
the flip side I think it's something</font>

135
00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:35.910 
<font color="Lime">that's more or less already been done you
know whaleshares that kind of a</font>

136
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:41.190 
<font color="Lime">thing similar but different so I think it'll
be interesting I think it's going</font>

137
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:45.720 
<font color="Lime">to initially be a whole flood of "BS" that
everyone's going</font>

138
00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:50.460 
<font color="Lime">to kind of have to go through because I
didn't read the</font>

139
00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:55.820 
<font color="Lime">entire white paper but I don't know what
system they're using to</font>

140
00:10:55.820 --> 00:11:02.940 
<font color="Lime">you know "vent through the BS" and the scam
tokens and whatnot</font>

141
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.240 
<font color="Lime">I don't know if it's just going to be whoever
makes one can enter it and use</font>

142
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:13.310 
<font color="Lime">steemit as the ICO platform but I think only
time will tell</font>

143
00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:19.029 position:80%
<font color="Violet">@nutela: the the best thing would be if we could use
steem like a form of discuss</font>

144
00:11:19.029 --> 00:11:22.899 
<font color="Violet">with the queue you know with like a common
system because the reputation</font>

145
00:11:22.899 --> 00:11:29.499 
<font color="Violet">could really help to leave the spammers out
and filter  the</font>

146
00:11:29.499 --> 00:11:34.899 
<font color="Violet">good commands but I don't know if it's like
for data I just saw</font>

147
00:11:34.899 --> 00:11:40.600 
<font color="Violet">some idea about it and which is very good you
know I I haven't read the</font>

148
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.709 
<font color="Violet">white paper also so
</font>

149
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:47.810 position:80%
<font color="Lime">@BamBam808: as we've seen the steemit
</font>

150
00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:51.920 
<font color="Lime">community issues pop up and there's people
that necessarily don't</font>

151
00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.580 
<font color="Lime">Use Steemit the platform for what it's for
but I think the community does a</font>

152
00:11:55.580 --> 00:12:00.740 
<font color="Lime">really good job of you know weeding out the
BS and then really getting down</font>

153
00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:05.810 
<font color="Lime">to the the good core community you know
people who really care about steemit so</font>

154
00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:09.830 
<font color="Lime">I think it's going to be a similar event with
these ICOS I think</font>

155
00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:13.130 
<font color="Lime">initially it's just gonna flood the market
and then everyone's gonna have to</font>

156
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:19.240 
<font color="Lime">kind of okay this is the one to go to this is
not you know like that</font>

157
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:24.840 position:80%
<font color="Yellow">@SirLunchTheHost: well if I may interject and I think I will
interject I think what's going to</font>

158
00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:25.180 position:80%
<font color="Lime">@BamBam808: no nobody wants to listen to you
</font>

159
00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:31.110 position:80%
<font color="Yellow">@SirLunchTheHost: happen is that it's going to separate people
who do shit and the people who don't</font>

160
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:36.480 
<font color="Yellow">do shit because even these tokens will be
backed by people's hard work</font>

161
00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:41.070 
<font color="Yellow">directly so i think that that problem you're
talking</font>

162
00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:48.060 
<font color="Yellow">about kind of sorts its way out but more or
less it will</font>

163
00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:53.180 
<font color="Yellow">plug the market but again it'll be a good
foot.</font>

164
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:07.320 
<font color="Yellow">yes I think it would be a good thing
</font>

165
00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.680 
<font color="Yellow">we'll see
</font>

166
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:17.780 
<font color="Violet">@nutela: so yeah if they can make it more easy to use
I think. you know making</font>

167
00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:23.060 
<font color="Violet">accounts on bitshares and doing this all and
watching the video of Kronos and I mean</font>

168
00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:28.820 
<font color="Violet">it's not hard but yeah I don't know if they
can make it easier then all</font>

169
00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:32.450 
<font color="Violet">the better but on the other hand maybe if
they make it too easy then you get</font>

170
00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:37.930 
<font color="Violet">all this shit coins time will tell.
</font>

171
00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:47.280 
<font color="Cyan">@officialfuzzy: my big thing is if you have a coin that it
cannot really</font>

172
00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:53.160 
<font color="Cyan">give people an opportunity to govern their
community or have some</font>

173
00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.150 
<font color="Cyan">semblance of structure that they can leverage
to get things</font>

174
00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:02.790 
<font color="Cyan">done that's one of the biggest things that
coins are gonna have</font>

175
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:06.390 
<font color="Cyan">to deal with that and scalability if you've
got those two things as a coin</font>

176
00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:13.500 
<font color="Cyan">your community is going to be able to survive
through the hard times and you</font>

177
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:18.710 
<font color="Cyan">will find those core people but I think over
time you guys might see that if</font>

178
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:23.010 
<font color="Cyan">for instance some of these other texts out
there if they don't scale and</font>

179
00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:29.940 
<font color="Cyan">the only thing that they offer is "you don't
like it sell your coin" I think that's</font>

180
00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:36.120 
<font color="Cyan">going to be the mark of what's going to make
a shit coin a true shit</font>

181
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:40.020 
<font color="Cyan">coin because if we're thinking about
cryptocurrency is something that's going</font>

182
00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:45.210 
<font color="Cyan">to empower people and it doesn't empower
people other than to buy the coin and</font>

183
00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:49.470 
<font color="Cyan">hold it and spend it and be a nice little
servant who doesn't ask questions</font>

184
00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:56.400 
<font color="Cyan">what happens with it or to be able to be a
citizen who has a say kind</font>

185
00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:00.690 
<font color="Cyan">of like and delegated proof of stake I think
there's a big big difference and</font>

186
00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:06.470 
<font color="Cyan">especially for longevity of coins and the
communities</font>

187
00:15:07.499 --> 00:15:12.339 
<font color="Cyan">especially for the toilet flushing people the
people who live their lives</font>
