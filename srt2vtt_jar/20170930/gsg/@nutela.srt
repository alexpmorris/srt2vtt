well I was just  wondering
SMT tokens how you see it and

2
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:59,220
because you wrote a post about it I just
read it so maybe we can talk about that

3
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:19,029
the the best thing would be if we
could use steem like a form of discuss

4
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:22,899
with the queue you know with like a
common system because the reputation

5
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:29,499
could really help to leave the spammers
out and filter  the

6
00:11:29,499 --> 00:11:34,899
good commands but I don't know
if it's like for data I just saw

7
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:40,600
some idea about it and which is
very good you know I I haven't read the

8
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,709
white paper also so

9
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,780
so yeah if they can make it more easy to
use I think. you know making

10
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:23,060
accounts on bitshares and doing this all
and watching the video of Kronos and I mean

11
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:28,820
it's not hard but yeah I don't know if
they can make it easier then all

12
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,450
the better but on the other hand maybe
if they make it too easy then you get

13
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:37,930
all this shit coins time will tell.
