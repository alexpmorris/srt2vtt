1
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:53,289
Sure and I'd like to begin well you said
something about tokens and if you guys

2
00:07:53,289 --> 00:08:06,569
know big Steem started as a translation
project for posts on Steem and for

3
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:14,430
all the things related to BtiShares, to
Steem [and] to Graphene technology in general.

4
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:26,289
And we were at some point I think it was
like last December or maybe January this

5
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:36,779
year [that] we're considering creating tokens
to sell translation things and with this

6
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:45,070
whole thing about community tokens we
might consider doing that actually but

7
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:52,000
it's something that I just wanted to say
for like kind of historical reasons.

8
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:01,149
We have a team of translators and we
have quite a bit of people who asked us

9
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:07,779
to translate things. When we started we were

10
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:13,360
thinking about how to monetize what we
are doing because you know most of

11
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:20,470
things we do we do for Steemit votes
and Golos votes. And sometimes they give

12
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:27,130
you nice payout and the translator is
happy because the money goes to the translators.

13
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:35,290
But sometimes not so much and we were
thinking about things that would allow

14
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:48,340
to have some sort of stable income.
But instead we went and start doing our

15
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:52,420
own interface for bitshares
and that also started as the translation

16
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:58,020
project. Because bitshares didn't have a
Russian interface at the time

17
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:08,670
and we were approached by testers who said
like "you guys are working on this maybe

18
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:17,130
you want to do Russian tools translation?"
We said yeah sure and then after we did

19
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:21,930
that we thought "okay we have this
interface translation we could probably

20
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:30,560
create our own interface and have a lot
of ideas about what we want to see on

21
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:40,800
bitshares". And that way we had an ability to
fullfill all of them. For example one of the

22
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:51,050
things that that we have that's
different from when BitShares started is our

23
00:10:51,320 --> 00:11:02,100
telegram based trollbox that we
have a sandboxed iframe with the chat

24
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:09,120
blog?? A lot of people say that was
a security problem and we spent a lot of

25
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:17,210
time to safeguard this. At some point we
were considering maybe seeing if there's

26
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:27,450
code for chatbrel?? and working on our own [version] so
we would know that it's safe enough.

27
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:37,830
Because when you are dealing
with cryptowallets such as Bit-

28
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:48,270
Shares DEX essentially you can't have
too much security. Anyway one of the

29
00:11:48,270 --> 00:12:00,600
things that we always wanted as a Ruble
MPA (Market Pegged Asset) and we created it and gave it

30
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:10,950
to the committee. So it's now an
official Ruble currency MPA of

31
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:16,990
BitShares
and all price

32
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:26,010
feeds for it are provided by 
producing??witnesses. And also after that,

33
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:33,640
since we position ourselves as Graphene
ambassadors for russian-speaking

34
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:45,280
audience we also worked and talked
with communities of Peerplays, of Muse

35
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:56,130
, of Golos and of Steem and Bitshares
itself and created 0% marketfee

36
00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:04,360
gateways that allow people to trade
their their tokens and exchange their

37
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:13,360
tokens from Graphene based networks
without any friction other than paying

38
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:21,670
miniscule Bitshares commissions. That
is made possible because we don't have

39
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:31,540
any investors that we
have any responsibilities [to] in turning a

40
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:43,060
profit and [things] like that. And also
[because] we have an active witness in

41
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:51,400
all those networks. In Bitshares we're a producing witness.

42
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:57,760
In Peerplays and in MUSE we're a producing
witness and in Steem and Golos we are

43
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:08,170
in the top 20 which is maybe one
or two percent ,or I don't know several

44
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:18,300
hundred thousand or like millions of
vests away from being a top 19 witness

45
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:24,510
and producing a block every round. But
even even without being there

46
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:30,960
we're still close to the top. On
Steem currently we've been running witness

47
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:38,040
since spring. I think it was late
March or early April when we

48
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:48,600
announced our the launch of our witness. We are still not in top 50 so if you

49
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,720
want to vote for a witness to support
whatever what we are doing, you'll have

50
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:03,030
to input the witness name in the field
for voting for non-in-the-top witnesses

51
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:14,210
and this name is "Blockchained" like
block chain ed. H opefully we

52
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:22,560
consider that most likely if enough
people vote for us we have to be made

53
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:31,320
like [rank] 30 and maybe eventually make it into the top. But top 30 would

54
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:37,920
be nice and I think it would be enough
to allow us to accelerate what

55
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:45,260
we're doing by quite a bit. Next up in the things that we are

56
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:50,700
planning to do:
we are currently tinkering with with the

57
00:15:50,700 --> 00:16:03,680
Ethereum nodes. We have to run one to be able to gain?? ERC20 tokens and our

58
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:15,510
first ERC 20 token, once we have that
operational is going to be EOS and I'm

59
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:25,160
not sure on the particulars yet but most
likely will have a 0% market fee for

60
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:35,070
EOS token only because at some point
it's going to be a Graphene based token. And once

61
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:45,649
that's happened we'll create a gateway for EOS.

62
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:55,019
Because we think that having Bitshares as a premier platform for EOS tokens and

63
00:16:55,019 --> 00:17:03,839
all the tokens created on EOS is
achievable and is actually

64
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:11,730
desirable because as far as I know there
are projects on creating DEXes on EOS

65
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:25,100
itself but we have the positioning to be
first such a DEX without actually

66
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:32,909
import?? to EOS because graphene chains
have an ability to sidechain to each

67
00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:43,110
other and hopefully within the next half
a year so teams on EOS and other chains

68
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:50,640
would realize the tools to allow that
and do all the research required for

69
00:17:50,640 --> 00:18:03,780
that. Next up we are probably going to
try and backport escrow functionality

70
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:12,710
from Steem into Bitshares. And we have a team of people who can work on that.

71
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:23,690
Possibly as soon as we are sure that
yeah that's feasible for us in a short term

72
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:31,830
will create a working proposal for that if
meirin?? beats?? us to that. Because escrow

73
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:41,429
functionality would allow creation of
peer to peer gating. So you will have

74
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:46,269
something along the lines of

75
00:18:46,269 --> 00:18:52,419
local bitcoins. Except local bitcoins
are a centralized service that allows

76
00:18:52,419 --> 00:19:04,619
peer to peer exchanges of bitcoins. [That said] we were researching using the multi-sig

77
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:13,259
schemes for that and decided that, while
it's possible it's still a bit clunky.

78
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:21,159
That's why we kind of shifted it some time into the

79
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:29,979
future. Once the tools that offer more
elegant solutions are in

80
00:19:29,979 --> 00:19:42,100
place.That's probably all for now,
if you have any questions... Oh yeah,

81
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:47,710
another thing is; hopefully if you are
going to Steemfest you will be able to

82
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:57,700
see me if I get my visa done in a timely
manner. Because if that happens I'll

83
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:04,419
go to Steemfest and do a presentation
there. But I'll know in maybe a week or

84
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:07,559
week and a half.

85
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:27,380
Yeah we translated a lot of text
for them and we are planning to have a

86
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:39,380
Decent gateway also powered by being a
witness on Decent Network. But it's

87
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:49,280
probably going to be after an
ERC20 gateway. Since it's not that

88
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,450
hard to create gateways for
graphene-based

89
00:20:53,450 --> 00:21:00,050
systems for us, it might happen before the ERC20 gateway but I'm not sure

90
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:09,590
on the timeline. But yeah that's in our plans and if you launch in

91
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:20,300
a Graphene based Network and you have a solid community and solid business case

92
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:31,370
for use of blockchain and are looking to
listed it we are open to providing

93
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:40,900
gateways to the DEX because as far as
we are concerned DEX is the thing that

94
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:49,460
tie all the Graphene based 
chains together. And any other

95
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:59,120
chains as well. But we first look for
several things: one of them is; if the

96
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:07,550
blockchain in question has any sort of
governance solutions, so you can in the

97
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:15,650
future expect to see maybe Decred or I
don't know - DASH. The second

98
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:22,610
thing is privacy centric block chains
that's something that we really like. So

99
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:30,860
Monero, ZCash,
I don't know PIVX or well whatever, are

100
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:34,989
the chains that have
functionality we are looking into

101
00:22:34,989 --> 00:22:48,220
creating but that's probably going to
be in 2018, maybe earlier. Our

102
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:57,999
idea is that we want to move at the pace
that's comfortable for us. So we are

103
00:22:57,999 --> 00:23:05,690
sort of you know when done,
there are no ATA's but for Graphene based

104
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:11,210
chains it's maybe like we got to asses
about that, we got to to set up the

105
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:17,470
infrastructure for that and now that we
have, to test that and release into the

106
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:24,289
to the public. And then another couple of
weeks to do a public testing before we

107
00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:31,009
send the code upstream. So it can be
included into the reference wallets and

108
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:38,769
into any other the Bitshares based
interfaces.

109
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:59,600
You'll still have to do it via Bitshares.
You send your money to for example

110
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:06,920
Decent gateway on Bitshares. You get Rudex decent tokens or

111
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:12,800
whatever they're going to be called. Then
you go and exchange them for, I don't

112
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:21,170
know Rudex tokens, and can then
send them to news network. And the thing

113
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:30,350
is since there are a 0% market fees
we're not actually taking any money from

114
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:40,040
from those trades. And since most
most graphene-based block chains don't

115
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:49,580
have sending or receiving fees or
transaction fees. We we have zero

116
00:24:49,580 --> 00:25:00,320
transaction fees to send it this way or that. And even with Bitshares and Peer-

117
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,210
plays that have those transaction fees,
since we are getting paid by the

118
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:15,680
blockchain and the volume on on those
movements is offset by those payments so

119
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:30,830
we are able to afford that, there are
minimum amounts that we process. But

120
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:38,600
it's still it's still pretty
friction free frictionless for you if

121
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:46,340
you're sending money from one blockchain
to another. But it still requires

122
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:58,910
people willing to to trade. Well maybe
depending on how liquid the

123
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:08,180
market, is it may be best if you take your Decent tokens sell them

124
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:16,130
for Bitshares and then say buy MUSE tokens
for Bitshares but still [you have to exchange]. And yeah one of

125
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:23,890
the things that the community can help
us with is doing the... Yeah.

126
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,940
Yeah, okay no problem.

127
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:37,380
Yeah sure cool. So one of the things that
you can help us with is market making. If

128
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:45,020
you have a lot of tokens or one of those
chains, you are welcome to come and

129
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:52,980
provide the liquidity for them. Yeah. Also
vote for witnesses on all those networks.

130
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:59,130
We are looking for votes on Steem and
in the chat here there were details about

131
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:02,900
that. Yeah, thank you for having me.

132
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:30,670
Power?? You can leave comments on our
steem blog. You could also contact us our

133
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:34,770
own on telegram.

134
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:42,710
We have a really heavy presence on
telegram with several several groups for

135
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:48,740
all these Graphene chains. So we have Peer plays rooms??, EOS rooms,

136
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:54,350
we have Bitshares DEX rooms and
all of them.

137
00:27:54,350 --> 00:28:01,270
Yeah I think yeah. In the chat here's
the links, the device posting them.
