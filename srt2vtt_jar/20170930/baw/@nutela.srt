1
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:52,750
did they fix the memory map problem

2
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:28,930
i per month or what

3
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:35,010
and so are the earnings based on the top

4
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:57,470
that's really rare but so does the
whole blockchain need to be in memory than

5
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:16,530
that's always better to you know 
read it but it's better to hear

6
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:21,110
it sounds more plausible

7
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:32,690
you should be a programmer fuzzzy
