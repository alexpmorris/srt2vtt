00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:07,009
@markymark you want to step up and chat
a little bit about the buildawhale

2
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,930
you

3
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:01,379
well I just wanted to say because of
this and I've been pretty pumped up

4
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:04,829
since I heard this since you told me what
was going on and that you've gotten to

5
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:10,950
this point and just because of 
the progression so I'll just say if

6
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:16,019
anybody wants to go out and and kind of
show the progression through audio

7
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:22,859
parts from project BuildaWhalel on
soundcloud you can download them and

8
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:29,730
maybe I'll just post
something about it for like 300 beyondbit

9
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:35,639
reward or something to have people
posts kind of like let's get a

10
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:40,079
timeline auditive of audio clips for you
saying we have this much we have this

11
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:44,519
much we have this much you know maybe through in
a little song in the background

12
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,299
or something

13
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:57,970
@steempowerpics is pretty good man I'm
sure that he can do it

14
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:03,630
if you ask him but I will gladly pitch
in toward it men to be honest it for

15
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,720
something like that I think these are
the types of things that if the

16
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,640
community showcases them this is your
content right its

17
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,169
downloadable by everybody you can go out
and download it it's raw you can

18
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:20,220
edit it to do whatever you want except
obviously lie and make it sound like

19
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:25,080
MarkyMark put his words
together to say that he kills goats on

20
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:30,510
mountaintops and eats their eyeballs or something weird if you

21
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,139
do that if you do that we'll probably
come after you

22
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:41,030
but other than that definitely verified
but first he dragon breaths them right

23
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,030
but

24
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,860
you

25
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:53,880
really quick markymark I need to ask
you have you done

26
00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:00,350
anything with the website yet or are
you getting started on that

27
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,170
you

28
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,919
you

29
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:08,580
well we actually have the reason I bring
this up is we have it's it's not

30
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:16,560
finished but it's in MVP form for a  front-end website

31
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,800
we're gonna make
it for US talk we're gonna have it too

32
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:26,850
so quite literally you'll have the
trending content from there that

33
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:31,890
you can actually kind of have a
news visualization for the forums right

34
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:35,820
so you might be out you don't want to go
looking at the forums on your cell phone

35
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:40,260
but you can go and check and see what
the news site looks like and what's

36
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:44,910
going on right and you can actually
break it down into various tags and you

37
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:49,110
know have a primary tag with subtags
underneath it and all the

38
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:54,270
things go there and the
reason why I bring this up is in the

39
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:58,650
current form you might see that there's
some tools that you have access to in

40
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:02,940
there there and some code that you can
utilize and I've paid for it

41
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:08,880
I meanI need more people to
probably work with it anyway and I don't

42
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,690
mind if people take it and just it was
supposed to be open source from the very

43
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:19,050
beginning I just got the guy who started
building it was a very fun story that

44
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:26,520
you guys can go listen to the archive of
at any point in time looking back on

45
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,660
it its actually quite funny but it
is available if you're interested in

46
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,520
checking it over man you just have to be
obviously stubbornly persistent to make

47
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,320
sure I get you in connection with the
guy

48
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,890
I believe
that it was meant to

49
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:53,280
be able to be a wordpress plugin

50
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:58,260
yeah
well that sounds like these two

51
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,120
things might marry together then pretty
well buddy

52
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,120
you
sounds good

53
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,310
you

54
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,360
I think
we talked a little about this art

55
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,700
together last night maybe it was gosh
I've been staying up so late doing stuff

56
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:23,300
the nights trail I think it was last
night that we talked but regarding the

57
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,200
full node that you're planning on
running for Steem

58
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,790
just make sure to let me know what you
need as far as how much it cost to run

59
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:37,079
and we can do that
at least until you get a witness you

60
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:39,440
know what I mean

61
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:51,209
anybody have any questions or comments we have about 3 minutes left

62
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,430
you

63
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,630
 

64
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,770
you

65
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,970
who makes steem watch

66
00:13:55,699 --> 00:13:57,759
you

67
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:04,330
you

68
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,270
but you see that's the problem that I
have with that name I don't know if

69
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:30,130
that's serious or if it's like saying
actually like it like kind of like null

70
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:37,839
you

71
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,310
you

72
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,579
well it seems like 15 minutes went by
pretty dang quickly on this but I will

73
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:14,120
say Marky it made me
smile when you're like I'm a

74
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:19,319
250-thousand Steem power buildawhale is now a whale and I know and I

75
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:22,980
want to make this clear to everybody
because the Marky Mark the way he's

76
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:30,480
doing this is he's leasing steam power
so he's not doing this for his

77
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,740
own profit quite as much as he is to try
to make something that's extremely

78
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:41,759
valuable and intrinsically valuable and
putting money back into the pockets of

79
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,709
people who are doing things that are
bringing value so it's it's a very

80
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:52,410
important point I guess to bring up to
consider voting for him and I'll say

81
00:15:52,410 --> 00:16:00,000
this he's watching you on steemwatch so
if to you vote him up he knows you

82
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,910
did buddy so anyway all jokes
aside how do they reach out to you Marky

83
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,089
Mark

84
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,650
you

85
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,850
you

86
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,870
you

87
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,840
you

88
00:16:53,840 --> 00:17:00,440
good job man and these are the
types of things like whenever I'm

89
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,780
seeing what xanoxt is doing what voiceshares is doing Marky Mark  these guys

90
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:11,870
have been coming here for quite some
time now and to be able to to watch the

91
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:17,300
seeds as they're planted start growing
is probably one of the biggest blessings

92
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:23,870
that these hangouts have offered me
personally and I'll just say

93
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:28,069
these are the types of things that
rather than focus on television and all

94
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:34,190
the negative stuff that's going on maybe
just maybe we can leverage this type of

95
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:40,220
stuff what we're doing here to create a
new model that shows people that they

96
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,970
don't need to watch the negative shit on
television and that maybe they can

97
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:48,440
actually create their own stories and
archive their own stories the good and the

98
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:56,810
bad and show it truthfully honestly and
build value and prove it and show the

99
00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:02,500
world that you can go through troubling
difficult times and still emerge

100
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:08,360
stronger and victorious so with that
said I appreciate everybody who joins

101
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:13,600
the whale tank and I look forward to
watching you all become whales
