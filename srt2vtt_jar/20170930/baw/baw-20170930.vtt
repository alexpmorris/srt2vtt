we're gonna be doing we're also</font>

31

the curated digested content and</font>

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:45.650 
<font color="Pink">feature it on a website that's outside of
steemi and that's most of what I have to</font>

<font color="Pink">talk about that's public right now so I'll

going on and that you've gotten to</font>

<font color="Pink">@themarkymark: no it's something I'm thinking about that one
of the problems is a canonical thing</font>

78
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:07.160 
<font color="Pink">is a duplicate content which becomes very
tricky because the whole advantage</font>

currently SEOs very well that's not</font>

81
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:17.660 
<font color="Pink">going to happen for long oh it's about to get
nerfed so putting on a separate</font>

82
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.980 
<font color="Pink">site wouldn't bring more traffic into Steemit
the problem is it's a</font>

83
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.180 
<font color="Pink">canonical issue because now you have the
content of each one you have to delegate</font>

84
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.230 
<font color="Pink">which one is supposed to be the origin of the
content and you do that with a</font>

85
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:35.150 
<font color="Pink">Google canonical tag so I have to figure out
like which way it probably</font>

<font color="Cyan">@officialfuzzy: you
</font>

87
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.560 
<font color="Pink">@themarkymark: wanted to do the site or something like that
so the traffic would come there</font>

88
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.010 
<font color="Pink">then go in or something like that I haven't
figured out but it was something</font>

89
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.730 
<font color="Pink">I was thinking about I'm not sure if I'm
going to do it because it does create</font>

90
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:52.400 
<font color="Pink">two things in there unless there was another
reason for the site to gain</font>

91
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.590 
<font color="Pink">traffic or have people on it it doesn't serve
a ton of purposes but I was just</font>

92
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:02.530 
<font color="Pink">thinking of ways of getting people funneled
into steam it</font>

93
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:08.580 
<font color="Cyan">@officialfuzzy: well we actually have the reason I bring this
up is we have it's it's not</font>

94
00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:16.560 
<font color="Cyan">finished but it's in MVP form for a 
front-end website</font>

95
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.800 
<font color="Cyan">we're gonna make it for US talk we're gonna
have it too</font>

96
00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:26.850 
<font color="Cyan">so quite literally you'll have the trending
content from there that</font>

97
00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:31.890 
<font color="Cyan">you can actually kind of have a news
visualization for the forums right</font>

98
00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:35.820 
<font color="Cyan">so you might be out you don't want to go
looking at the forums on your cell phone</font>

99
00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:40.260 
<font color="Cyan">but you can go and check and see what the
news site looks like and what's</font>

100
00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:44.910 
<font color="Cyan">going on right and you can actually break it
down into various tags and you</font>

101
00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:49.110 
<font color="Cyan">know have a primary tag with subtags
underneath it and all the</font>

102
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:54.270 
<font color="Cyan">things go there and the reason why I bring
this up is in the</font>

103
00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:58.650 
<font color="Cyan">current form you might see that there's some
tools that you have access to in</font>

104
00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:02.940 
<font color="Cyan">there there and some code that you can
utilize and I've paid for it</font>

105
00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:08.880 
<font color="Cyan">I meanI need more people to probably work
with it anyway and I don't</font>

106
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.690 
<font color="Cyan">mind if people take it and just it was
supposed to be open source from the very</font>

107
00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:19.050 
<font color="Cyan">beginning I just got the guy who started
building it was a very fun story that</font>

108
00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:26.520 
<font color="Cyan">you guys can go listen to the archive of at
any point in time looking back on</font>

109
00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.660

available if you're interested in</font>

110
00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:35.520 
<font color="Cyan">checking it over man you just have to be
obviously stubbornly persistent to make</font>

before how everything is centralized</font>

129
00:09:41.549 --> 00:09:48.399 
<font color="Pink">with the witnesses in a full node, so I was
looking at doing it a full node that</font>

130
00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:50.320 
<font color="Pink">would be public and I thought maybe we could
do a community one for Whaleshares</font>

131
00:09:52.629 --> 00:09:58.239 
<font color="Pink">or something like that like Minnow support
did but I'm still thinking about</font>

132
00:09:58.239 --> 00:10:02.049 
<font color="Pink">the technicalities of stuff like that, right
now I'm sitting on my second</font>

that</font>

been staying up so late doing stuff</font>

136
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:23.300

that we talked but regarding the</font>

Steem</font>

138
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:31.790 
<font color="Cyan">just make sure to let me know what you need
as far as how much it cost to run</font>

139
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:37.079 
<font color="Cyan">and we can do that at least until you get a
witness you</font>

have about 3 minutes left</font>

143
00:10:55.439 --> 00:10:59.279 
<font color="Pink">@themarkymark: the witness is about fifty two hundred
dollars for the hardware then you have</font>

get high enough like I'm getting</font>

146
00:11:04.889 --> 00:11:09.599 
<font color="Pink">high enough where it's kind of expected to
have a backup and then you need to</font>

147
00:11:09.599 --> 00:11:13.979 
<font color="Pink">double that and then you need to have another
server that basically can remote</font>

148
00:11:13.979 --> 00:11:18.419 
<font color="Pink">kill switch them preferably 2 so you're
looking at two to four servers</font>

149
00:11:18.419 --> 00:11:23.869 
<font color="Pink">when you start getting it to the range that
I'm in</font>

150
00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:36.490 
<font color="Pink">and right now you need a 16-gig server and
that's growing fairly fast well you</font>

12-gigs right now so it pretty much has</font>

153
00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:44.110 
<font color="Pink">16 gigs right now and it'll be breaking that
which means you'll have to get a 32</font>

154
00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:47.550 
<font color="Pink">gig which brings the price up a bit

156
00:11:49.579 --> 00:11:55.679 position:80%
<font color="Pink">@themarkymark: no but you're talking most likely about a
full node that requires 128 gigs</font>

157
00:11:55.679 --> 00:12:00.329 
<font color="Pink">actually 104 but you're looking at 128-gig
server and most</font>

158
00:12:00.329 --> 00:12:05.249 
<font color="Pink">people that are doing it to go for a 256 gig
server because 128 is not going to</font>

159
00:12:05.249 --> 00:12:11.069 
<font color="Pink">last long so you're talking very limited
options when you start talking about</font>

160
00:12:11.069 --> 00:12:15.600 
<font color="Pink">that calibre server because there's just not
many places that will host it, if you</font>

161
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:20.790 
<font color="Pink">do something like that like Rackspace which
is a triple-a hosting</font>

162
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:28.049 
<font color="Pink">company your looking over $1,000 yeah per

</font>

166
00:12:33.079 --> 00:12:36.779 position:80%
<font color="Pink">@themarkymark: there's absolutely no earnings for a full
node and that's what makes it suck</font>

167
00:12:36.779 --> 00:12:43.319 
<font color="Pink">it's the most expensive server you can rent
256 is</font>

168
00:12:43.319 --> 00:12:52.410 
<font color="Pink">insane and there's no benefit to the person
hosting it there is no financial</font>

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:55.249

blockchain need to be in memory than</font>

171
00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:03.780 
<font color="Pink">@themarkymark: because the way it was designed what's not
really smart for scaling</font>

172
00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:07.910

you who witness voted me like instantly</font>

177
00:13:24.129 --> 00:13:27.850 
<font color="Pink">it's because I'm using a service called
