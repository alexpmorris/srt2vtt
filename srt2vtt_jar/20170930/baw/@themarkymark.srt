1
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:09,530
hey now it's going yeah
so for those who don't know buildawhale

2
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:17,660
is a bidding bot you send $0.50 SBD or
more we raised it because of things I'm

3
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:23,029
going to talk about and then we do a bid
or a vote down in about 2 hours and 40

4
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:26,210
minutes and that's how our cycle works
similar to a booster and all the other

5
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,779
ones
nothing new there and then we have human

6
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:34,370
curation at the back-end where we review
all the posts that come in there's about

7
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:39,200
a hundred plus a day it's getting to be
a lot more now and we review it we

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,050
pick 5 of them each day and we do a
daily digest and put that out on BuildaWhale

9
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:50,960
as well and then now we're doing a
contest in a weekend where on Saturdays

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,170
we announce the five best
curated articles for the week

11
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:02,149
picked from all the curators and then
the community can go and vote up and

12
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:05,500
pick which ones they think should win
and then the winners get WhaleShares

13
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:11,060
for winning that, theres a first, second
and third place for that, we

14
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:17,260
announced it yesterday and we're about
to announce the contenders for this week

15
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:23,570
the other thing I wanted announces we
now have 250,000 steem power so we are

16
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:29,930
now officially a whale and we're
dropping I think it's like 33 $34 votes

17
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:34,369
and it's going up as the seven-day
average of steem goes up so it will be in

18
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:41,810
a 35-40 range real soon
we also have a giveaway where anyone

19
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:47,930
that resteems our digest has an
opportunity of winning a free sponsored

20
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:52,520
curation and like we said before the
sponsored curation is you could pay

21
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:59,290
three steem to buildawhale and bypass
the entire queue and not have to be

22
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:05,270
curated through all the hundred plus
posts and you'd be featured right at the

23
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:12,200
top as a sponsored curation and as long
as it's not porn or anything unethical

24
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,090
we don't censor anything we just will
put you through

25
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:23,330
then we'll read it and give
you a human touch curation for that and

26
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:28,250
that's completely free if you win it
through one of our giveaways and then we

27
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,790
have some other things that have come up
that we're gonna be doing we're also

28
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:39,739
considering doing a website that will
feature the curated digested content and

29
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:45,650
feature it on a website that's outside of
steemi and that's most of what I have to

30
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:49,880
talk about that's public right now so
I'll open up the questions or if anyone

31
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,930
wants a chat about it

32
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:52,170
I'm sure @steempowerpics has already
started

33
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:27,059
thanks Nick appreciate that

34
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,870
thanks man appreciate that

35
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,090
no it's something I'm thinking about that
one of the problems is a canonical thing

36
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:07,160
is a duplicate content which becomes
very tricky because the whole advantage

37
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,350
would be for SEO reasons but Steemit
currently SEOs very well that's not

38
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:17,660
going to happen for long oh it's about
to get nerfed so putting on a separate

39
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,980
site wouldn't bring more traffic into Steemit the problem is it's a

40
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,180
canonical issue because now you have the
content of each one you have to delegate

41
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,230
which one is supposed to be the origin
of the content and you do that with a

42
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:35,150
Google canonical tag so I have to
figure out like which way it probably

43
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:39,560
wanted to do the site or something like
that so the traffic would come there

44
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,010
then go in or something like that I
haven't figured out but it was something

45
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:46,730
I was thinking about I'm not sure if I'm
going to do it because it does create

46
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:52,400
two things in there unless there was
another reason for the site to gain

47
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,590
traffic or have people on it it doesn't
serve a ton of purposes but I was just

48
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:02,530
thinking of ways of getting people
funneled into steam it

49
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:43,550
is it code or is it actually a
site that's going up

50
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,089
okay because that's where I would go,

51
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:57,209
WordPress, if I was gonna host it myself
because that's what I do

52
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:07,660
you know take a look at it, the other
thing I wanted to mention is I posted a

53
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,170
link earlier with some of the nodes
going on today

54
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:18,639
thanks for the witness @nutela I posted
an image of all the nodes that are down

55
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:23,589
right now and it's like 3 out of 5 are
gone right now and (preevix?) is fixing

56
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:27,970
things right now
so they they did support all the plugins

57
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:33,160
so they shut it down it's taking 6
to 12 hours to replay the blocks and I

58
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,819
still haven't seen an update of them
coming back online and I know a lot of

59
00:09:36,819 --> 00:09:41,549
people use them like I was talking about
before how everything is centralized

60
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:48,399
with the witnesses in a full node, so I
was looking at doing it a full node that

61
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,320
would be public and I thought maybe we
could do a community one for Whaleshares

62
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:58,239
or something like that like Minnow
support did but I'm still thinking about

63
00:09:58,239 --> 00:10:02,049
the technicalities of stuff like that,
right now I'm sitting on my second

64
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:07,199
witness so I have a failover and stuff
like that

65
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,020
I will do

66
00:10:55,439 --> 00:10:59,279
the witness is about fifty two hundred
dollars for the hardware then you have

67
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,889
to maintain it which is interesting once
you get high enough like I'm getting

68
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:09,599
high enough where it's kind of expected
to have a backup and then you need to

69
00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:13,979
double that and then you need to have
another server that basically can remote

70
00:11:13,979 --> 00:11:18,419
kill switch them preferably 2 so
you're looking at two to four servers

71
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:23,869
when you start getting it to the range
that I'm in

72
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:36,490
and right now you need a 16-gig server
and that's growing fairly fast well you

73
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:40,330
can get away with a smaller one but it's
12-gigs right now so it pretty much has

74
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:44,110
16 gigs right now and it'll be breaking
that which means you'll have to get a 32

75
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:47,550
gig which brings the price up a bit

76
00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:55,679
no but you're talking most likely
about a full node that requires 128 gigs

77
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:00,329
actually 104 but you're looking at
128-gig server and most

78
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:05,249
people that are doing it to go for a 256
gig server because 128 is not going to

79
00:12:05,249 --> 00:12:11,069
last long so you're talking very limited
options when you start talking about

80
00:12:11,069 --> 00:12:15,600
that calibre server because there's just
not many places that will host it, if you

81
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,790
do something like that like Rackspace
which is a triple-a hosting

82
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:28,049
company your looking over $1,000 yeah per
month and that's without any support or

83
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:31,309
redundancy or anything on that

84
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:36,779
there's absolutely no earnings for a
full node and that's what makes it suck

85
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:43,319
it's the most
expensive server you can rent 256 is

86
00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:52,410
insane and there's no benefit to the
person hosting it there is no financial

87
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:55,249
reward or anything

88
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:03,780
because the way it was designed
what's not really smart for scaling

89
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:07,910
and they worked on trying to fix
that but

90
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:11,980
thanks for the witnessing @zone

91
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:24,129
yeah if you guys are wondering how I can
tell you who witness voted me like instantly

92
00:13:24,129 --> 00:13:27,850
it's because I'm using a service called
steemwatch it will let you know if

93
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,360
somebody witness votes you and also let
you know if somebody unwitnessed votes

94
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,540
you and then it also will tell you if
you get notified in apost or

95
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,360
something like that, it has a few other
things like if someone posts or

96
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,870
something like that which it's kind of
buggy like setting it up once you have

97
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,410
the alerts set though it's good but
actually setting them up it takes a few

98
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,189
tries some times

99
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:58,360
I don't know I set it up a couple days
ago and I don't know who said it but I found

100
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,709
out about it from Tim clif but I was
building something similar that would

101
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:09,579
notify me through pushover about when
I change rank and so if somebody approves

102
00:14:09,579 --> 00:14:14,339
me or something like that or I miss a
block or something like that

103
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:38,190
yeah it's the user void I guess I'd even
look at who made it I just started

104
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:44,300
checking out because Tim cliff said it
and he's pretty damn cool

105
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,260
it does work awesome though but it is really
really buggy like when you go and say

106
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:59,400
this is the first thing I want to
monitor it takes forever to do it, it takes

107
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:04,340
like four or five tries thanks Khan
Electric for the vote

108
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,389
discord and steemit chat are where I
usually hang out and I could post a link for

109
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:17,759
the discord for BuildaWhale but if you just tag me you'll find

110
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:23,280
me on most of the service
thanks Nick that's the unexpired one so

111
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,840
you just have to use it today

112
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:35,290
oh it is okay thought they had the same link
because I recognize the unexpirement

113
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,630
okay cool

114
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:43,000
you know we are looking at doubling the
steem power soon if this thing works out

115
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,080
but right now it's not a profitable
indenter we're trying to see if we could

116
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,950
at least make it so we don't have to
keep funneling fire into this thing to

117
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:54,060
keep it to the next week
